      <div>Hi! I'm TheColaber! You may know me from Scratch, GitHub, Discord, or YouTube... either way, this is my site!</div>
      <div>I like to work on things that are useful to me. Such as many addons I have made for scratch and turbowarp.</div>
      <div>Once in a while I make project for scratch, either dumb or my level of complexity.</div>
      <div>But usually I'll be out in GitHub, exploring the infinte repos of the world.</div>
      <div>I've worked on many projects which you can find in my projects section...</div>
      <div>Anyways, enough about me, go ahead and explore my site.</div>
